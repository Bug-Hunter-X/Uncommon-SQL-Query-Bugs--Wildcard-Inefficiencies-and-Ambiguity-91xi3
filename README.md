This repository contains examples of uncommon SQL bugs related to wildcard character usage and potential data ambiguity. The `bug.sql` file demonstrates queries that can yield unexpected outcomes or be inefficient due to wildcard usage. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides improved, more efficient, and less ambiguous alternatives using unique identifiers and more precise selection criteria.  This is important for large datasets to avoid unintended issues and maintain database performance.  Review the comments in each file for detailed explanations.
